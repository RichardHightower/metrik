# metrik
Interfaces for gathering runtime metrics, KPIs, and other stats for Microservice Container Development. Supports Consul, StatsD, InfluxDB and more.

Coming soon.

We are pulling some code out of QBit and other projects, and making it more general. 

There will be a base jar which just defines interfaces.
